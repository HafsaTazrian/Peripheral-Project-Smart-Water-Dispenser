### Project Overview:
We have built a Smart Water Dispenser using Arduino UNO. It performs mainly two tasks
- When a glass is places below the dispensing nozzle it will automatically detect the glass and fill it and then stop water flow so that glass does not overflow. This is done using IR sensor.
- When the main water tank is not filled with water, it will automatically detect it and fill up the tank. And when the water level has reached a certain height it will stop filling up the water tank. This is done by Water Detector Sensor
